The next step is to store each received message in the corresponding client's database. Afterward, we implement an algorithm that detects which meters have not sent information on a specific date. Finally, we request the missing information for that particular date via Web Services, so that if we retrieve the data, it is stored in the database, and the previous algorithm is re-executed to check that the information has been retrieved successfully."
